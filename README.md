# calculatron-3000
Simple calculator  for The Odin Project

Final Project for **The Odin Project: Foundations Curriculum!**

## Reinforcing all of the concepts I've mastered so far in..

 - HTML
 - CSS
 - JS

Pulling out ~~all~~ *(not really)* the stops to make an awesome calculator!

I'm assuming that I'll be using:
 - Functions
 - DOM Manipulation
 - HTML and CSS basics
 - Markdown syntax for this README

## **Things to do**
1. Fix some minor details with the current CSS
     - Viewport changes size if there is nothing displayed.
     - Need to re-do the CSS grid to acommodate the extra credit items below.

2. Extra credit
     - Implement a decimal button.
     - Implement a backspace button
     - Keyboard support

3. Clean up the code

4. Pretti-fy the CSS

## **UPDATES**

## 2/4/22 0335
 - Finally got the calculator into working order. Logic was tough to figure out, but with (alot) of tinkering I was able to get the numbers to store properly in the variables, and operate on them in a way that makes sense. Code needs **a-f---in-Lot** of optimization and cleaning. But the main thing is that it works. **update @0355** I also forgot to keep it from crashing when the user tries to divide by zero. Please avoid doing so to prevent wormholes to alternate universes from opening üëç
